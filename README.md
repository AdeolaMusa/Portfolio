## Problem Statement
- What is the Average income per Customers?
- Which region has the highest impact on the sales?
- What Age bracket purchased bike more?
- What is the Average distance of customers commute?

## Skills / Concept demonstrated
I used Power Query to clean and transform the data while using Power Pivot to analyse and create models. Other tools used includes; slicers, filters, DAX. Leveraging visualization tools, I created charts, graphs, and pivot tables to showcase key Performance metrics.

## Recommendation
- Diversifying the product selection to include bikes that appeal more to female customers is a great strategy for wider market
- monitor sales performance and customer feedback in Europe and the Pacific to identify areas for improvement and fine-tune strategies accordingly

## Conclusion

For making accurate data-driven decisions, datasets from previous years should be analyzed and results compared with current data to identify trends, patterns, and changes over time.

- Explore cross selling strategy by encouraging customers who purchase from the Novelty shop to explore complementary products from other sections at discounted prices. everyone loves discounts!
- Gather customer feedback to identify painpoints and reasons for not shopping at the oher departments
- Allocate more marketing efforts, and inventory to the other departmental category
